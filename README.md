# Bike-sharing Program in Des Moines
## Background
To put together a solid business proposal for Des Moines Iowa on a bike-sharing business, a data set for New York city was leveraged to gain insights to consumer behavior.  Insights of trip duration and usage times throughout the week for different consumers for the month of August in 2019 was used.

# Analysis
## Deliverable 1 
The NY City bike data source needs the trip duration converted to a datetime format for our usage in Tableau.  A Jupyter Notebook NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb was leveraged to import the data set file 2019-08-citibike-tripdata.csv, add the desired trip duration field of datetime format, and then save that out as a new file named citbike_data.csv.
