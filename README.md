# Bike-sharing Program in Des Moines
Tableau Public VIZ for Bike Share in Des Moines Iowa
# To put together a solid business proposal for Des Moines Iowa on a bike-sharing business, a data set for New York city was leveraged to gain insights to consumer behavior.  Insights of trip duration and usage times throughout the week for different consumers.

# Analysis
## Deliverable 1 
The NY City bike data source needs the trip duration converted to a datetime format for our usage in Tableau.  A Jupyter Notebook NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb was leveraged to import the data set file 2019-08-citibike-tripdata.csv, add the desired trip duration field of datetime format, and then save that out as a new file named citbike_data.csv.
